# Code of Conduct

## Essentials

The lab, and the university, is an environment that must be free of harassment and discrimination. All lab members are expected to abide by the University policies on discrimination and harassment.

The lab is committed to ensuring a safe, friendly, and accepting environment for everybody. We will not tolerate any verbal or physical harassment or discrimination on the basis of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We will not tolerate intimidation, stalking, following, unwanted photography or video recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Finally, it should go without saying that lewd language and behavior have no place in the lab, including any lab outings.

If you notice someone being harassed, or are harassed yourself, tell Geoff immediately. If Geoff is the cause of your concern, then reach out to the department chair or another trusted faculty member in the department. If the issue includes sexual harassment, gender-based discrimination, and sexual violence, please contact Pitt's Title IX office: https://www.titleix.pitt.edu
