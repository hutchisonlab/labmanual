# Research

We do fundamental science that hopefully will have broader impacts on technology. In general, that means we're trying out new research ideas and things may not always work. This is both the joy of discovery and the grind of understanding why your experiment is half-successful. Research often uncovers more questions than answers.

Each of you will work on your own independent research project. In addition to allowing the group to work on a wider range of topics, it allows you the flexibility to progress at your own pace. Of course there are research overlaps and I expect you to help your fellow group members if they need assistance with something - particularly as they're starting their own projects.
