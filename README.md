# The Hutchison Research Group

> “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.”
- Pres. John F. Kennedy

The Hutchison Research Group focuses on understanding fundamental properties of pi-conjugated molecules to design new materials. We combine computational exploration, often using evolutionary algorithms and machine learning, with experimental characterization.

Science can be hard, but it should also be fun.
