# Lab Resources

### Slack

Slack will be used as the primary means of lab communication via https://HutchisonGroup.slack.com - although there are other  workspaces for some projects (e.g., interacting with Open Babel, Avogadro, or the broader Open Chemistry community). These are open - just ask Geoff for pointers.

Try to keep each channel on topic, so that people can subscribe only to the channels that concern them. For messages to one person or a small group, use direct messages. If you have to send attachments (e.g., papers) or send messages that include out-of-lab recipients, use e-mail. If it’s an emergency and Geoff isn’t responding on Slack, call or e-mail him.

Full-time lab members should install Slack on their computers and/or phones. Part-time lab members should also check Slack regularly. You should of course feel free to ignore Slack on evenings and weekends – and Geoff probably will, too!

### Trello

Geoff has created a lab Trello board to track projects and manuscript progress. Group members should have an invitation - if not, ask Geoff. When we meet weekly, we should discuss progress and ideally update relevant project cards, boards, etc.

### GitHub

There is a lab GitHub organization https://github.com/hutchisonlab to share code, data, supporting information for papers, etc.
Usually the easiest solution is to clone from your repo at time of publication. Open data leads to open reproducible science, which is the whole goal.

when we share data, we want to provide logical organization - have other lab members and Geoff check if possible. When sharing code through the group organization, we want to make sure it's high quality. You wouldn't want to use someone's buggy code, so the Golden Rule says that you should share good code too.

## Research

We do fundamental science that hopefully will have broader impacts on technology. In general, that means we're trying out new research ideas and things may not always work. This is both the joy of discovery and the grind of understanding why your experiment is half-successful. Research often uncovers more questions than answers.

Each of you will work on your own independent research project. In addition to allowing the group to work on a wider range of topics, it allows you the flexibility to progress at your own pace. Of course there are research overlaps and I expect you to help your fellow group members if they need assistance with something - particularly as they're starting their own projects.

## General Notes

### Meetings

#### Weekly Group Meetings

We typically have weekly meetings (~1 hour), usually with one group member presenting a journal article or a mini-tutorial, and another group member presenting an update on their research project for feedback, suggestions, venting, etc.

Projects at any level of completion (or even not yet started!) can benefit from being presented. There is merit in presenting unfinished results to get feedback and to simply get better at presenting. These lab meetings can also be used to talk about methods, statistical analyses, new papers, and career development. For paper discussions, everyone must come to lab meeting having read the paper and prepared with comments and questions to contribute.

Everyone is expected to present at least once every semester. These meetings are informal, and you can do what you wish with your slot – just be prepared to contribute something substantive. Lab members are also expected to attend every meeting (obviously, illnesses, doctor appointments, family issues, teaching assignments, etc. are a valid reason for missing a meeting). Undergraduate students are encouraged to attend as often as possible (assuming it fits in their course schedule).

Usually, once per term, we have "5 Minute Talks" - everyone should present a quick talk about a topic relevant to science in 5 minutes. This does not need to be about your topic - the idea is to get better about giving quick summaries of science and hopefully for us to learn about outside science.

### Individual Meetings

At the beginning of each semester, we will try to set a schedule for weekly meetings. Each full-time lab member is expected to touch base with Geoff. If scheduling conflicts arise (e.g., because of travel), we can try to reschedule for another day that week. If there is nothing to discuss, let's at least have brief chat about plans for moving the project forward - these need not be formal sessions.

### Data Preservation

You should back up your computer. Backups are important for many reasons, but because you do not wish to lose data, writing, or anything else related to your work or digital life. I recommend (and use) both a regular backup drive and an online service. Geoff personally uses [BackBlaze](http://backblaze.com) but other services are also good. Automatic backup is key.

Pitt provides unlimited storage via Box.com which is useful for storing key data. Geoff uses both Box Sync and Dropbox to ensure his files are both online and backed up. More importantly both services allow us to collaborate on manuscripts (e.g., as you edit, finish figures, etc.).

When you leave the group, it is important that a copy of all your data is preserved for future work - the group has a networked RAID with 10TB storage that is maintained by Geoff - he will be happy to show you how to copy your data or access older group files.

### Open Science

We’re all for open science, so lab members are encouraged (well, required) to share their code and data with others, whether they are in the lab or outside of it. Within lab, you can share your code and data whenever you like. Outside of collaborators, please do not share code or data until you think (and Geoff agrees) that the lab is finished with it and it's ready for outside consumption, whether through publication or other milestone.

This gives us an opportunity to work with the data to meet our needs (including grant needs!) before releasing it for other people to use.

We will also share our work with the world as soon as we ready, which means preprints! The lab policy is to upload a preprint of a manuscript simultaneously with initial submission to a journal. The preferred preprint servers are ChemRxiv and arXiv. We will also put PDFs of all our papers on the lab website, and you should share PDFs of your paper with whoever asks.

As much as possible, we want to expose the raw data and any analysis scripts with publications. We do good science and have nothing to hide, so let's show that.

### Hours and Time Management

Hours in academia are more flexible than other jobs -- but you should still treat it as a real job (~40 hours/week) and show up on a regular basis. Some times will be busier than others and some times you may need to take work off (e.g., parents visiting, car repairs, doctors appointments, etc.). My main concern is that you're getting work done and that I see everyone on a regular basis.

***Take care of yourself.*** I fully believe that you can’t do your best work when you’re worn down, sick, tired, burnt out etc. Graduate school is a long process and the problems we tackle will take weeks and months, not days. Things won't always work. Self care is important and if there's time you want to work from home, take a day off, etc. just let me know.


## Funding

Funding for the group comes from a number of sources. If you're not sure the source of your funding, please ask. It is important to add acknowledgments to posters, presentation slides, and publications.

This includes not just raw funding ($$) but also resources like the Pitt Center for Research Computing (CRC) which provides computer time.

### Purchasing

If you need to buy something and are unsure how the process works, please contact Geoff. Some items should be charged to grants (i.e., for materials needed to carry out research) and some materials (e.g., office supplies) should be charged to internal accounts.

### Grant Preparation

At some point, you will probably be asked to provide a figure or three for a grant proposal or to provide feedback on a draft. Relatedly, you should feel free to read any grant Geoff has submitted, whether it is ultimately funded or not. Aside from being a good opportunity to see how grants are written, this also helps provide you with vision for where Geoff sees research going in the next few years.

## Last words

> We make tiny things which make power from the sun and other tiny things which make power from moving. These things can help power the world.
> We think hard about how stuff really works and how tiny things come together to make a whole.  By asking how tiny things work, we can make them work better.
> Part of our job is also to help other people to learn these things, and how to ask and answer new questions.
